# cells
#### Spreadsheet-like expressiveness for CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System.

Please check out the Wiki for motivation and general overview: https://github.com/kennytilton/cells/wiki

No documentation other than the test suite, but ping me for help. I am starting on a port to Clojure/ClojureScript called **MatrixCLJS**, residing temporarily at [TodoFRP MatrixCLJS](https://github.com/kennytilton/todoFRP/blob/matrixjs/todo/MatrixCLJS/README.md)

**MatrixCLJS** is pretty far along and in some ways exceeds Cells in capability and even has a benign issue fixed.

There is a [pure Javascript version](https://github.com/kennytilton/todoFRP/tree/matrixjs/todo/MatrixJS) as well.
